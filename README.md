# NBA MVP Predictions

This project involves analyzing historical NBA player data and building a machine learning model to predict the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for a given season. Using advanced analytics and data science techniques, the project aims to uncover patterns and key factors that influence the MVP selection process.

## Features

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**  
  In-depth analysis of player statistics, team performance, and other relevant factors. Includes visualizations to highlight trends and correlations.
  
- **Machine Learning Model**  
  A predictive model is trained using past seasons' data to forecast MVP winners. Techniques such as feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning are employed to maximize accuracy.
  
- **Notebook Workflow**  
  The project workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow and reproduce results. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**  
  Core programming language for data processing, analysis, and model implementation.
  
- **Pandas and NumPy**  
  For data manipulation and numerical computations.
  
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**  
  For data visualization.
  
- **Scikit-learn**  
  For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
